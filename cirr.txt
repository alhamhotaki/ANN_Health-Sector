The data set found in appendix D of Fleming and Harrington, Counting 
Processes and Survival Analysis, Wiley, 1991. The only differences are: 
age is in days 
status is coded as 0=censored, 1=censored due to liver tx, 2=death 
the sex and stage variables are not missing for obs 313-418 
  
Quoting from F&H. "The following pages contain the data from the Mayo Clinic 
trial in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) of the liver conducted between 1974 
and 1984. A description of the clinical background for the trial and the 
covariates recorded here is in Chapter 0, especially Section 0.2. A more 
extended discussion can be found in Dickson, et al., Hepatology 10:1-7 (1989) 
and in Markus, et al., N Eng J of Med 320:1709-13 (1989). 
"A total of 424 PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during that ten-year 
interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized placebo controlled 
trial of the drug D-penicillamine. The first 312 cases in the data set 
participated in the randomized trial and contain largely complete data."
